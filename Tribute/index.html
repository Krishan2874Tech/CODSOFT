        <h1>Tribute to Sir C. V. Raman</h1>
        <p>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (1888â€“1970) was an eminent Indian physicist known for his groundbreaking work in the field of light scattering. His most significant discovery, the <strong>Raman effect</strong>, revolutionized our understanding of how light interacts with matter.</p>
        <p>As a student, Raman demonstrated exceptional brilliance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At the age of 11, he passed his matriculation examination.</li>
            <li>By 13, he completed his 12th grade with a scholarship.</li>
            <li>He topped the bachelor's degree examination in physics from Presidency College at age 16.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>His journey continued with remarkable achievements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Published his first research paper on diffraction of light while still a graduate student.</li>
            <li>Obtained a master's degree the following year.</li>
            <li>Joined the Indian Finance Service in Calcutta at age 19.</li>
            <li>Contributed significantly to acoustics and optics at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let us honor this visionary scientist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930 for his extraordinary contributions.</p>
